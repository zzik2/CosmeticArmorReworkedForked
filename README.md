# CosmeticArmorReworked Fork 🐭

This repository is a fork of **CosmeticArmorReworked** by [zlainsama](https://github.com/zlainsama/). 😊

## Overview
CosmeticArmorReworked enables cosmetic equipment rendering while keeping gameplay stats intact. This fork adds an optional dual-rendering mode so you can see both the real equipment and the cosmetic gear at the same time. 🔥

## Supported Mod Loaders and Versions
- **Fabric**
- **NeoForge**

## Supported Minecraft versions: 
- **1.21.1**
- **1.21.2**(WIP)
- **1.21.3**(WIP)
- **1.21.4**(WIP)
- **1.21.5**(WIP)

- **1.21.8**(WIP)
- **1.21.9**(WIP)
- **1.21.10**(WIP)
- **1.21.11**(WIP)

## Dual Rendering Mode (CosArmorStackRendering)
By default, the mod renders either the real equipment or the cosmetic equipment.  
If you want to display both at once, enable the following client config option:

```json
// cosmeticarmorreworked-client.json
{
  "CosArmorStackRendering": true
}
```

This is useful in situations where you want to keep the cosmetic look but still verify the actual gear being worn.
